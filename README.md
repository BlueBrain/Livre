# Livre
![Livre](doc/images/livre_small.png)

Livre (Large-scale Interactive Volume Rendering Engine) is an out-of-core,
multi-node, multi-gpu, OpenGL volume rendering engine to visualise large
volumetric data sets. It can be retrieved by cloning the [source code]
(https://github.com/BlueBrain/Livre.git).

It provides the following major features to facilitate rendering of large volumetric data sets:
* Visualisation of pre-processed UVF format
  ([source code](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/Tuvok.git)) volume data sets.
* Real-time voxelisation of different data sources (surface meshes, BBP morphologies,
  local-field potentials, etc) through the use of plugins.
* Multi-node, multi-gpu rendering (Currently only sort-first rendering)

To keep track of the changes between releases check the [changelog](doc/Changelog.md).
