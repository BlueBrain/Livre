@section Technical_Features Technical Features

Livre is an out-of-core rendering engine that has the following features:

- Distributed rendering using Equalizer library (https://github.com/Eyescale/Equalizer)
(Sort-first is implemented, sort-last is in progress)

- Lock-free data sharing using DASH library (https://github.com/BlueBrain/dash)

- Octree based out-of-core rendering
- Visualisation of pre-processed UVF format.
  ([source code](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/Tuvok.git)) volume data sets.
- Real-time voxelisation of different data sources (surface meshes, BBP morphologies,
  local-field potentials, etc) through the use of plugins.

- Multi-node, multi-gpu rendering (currently only sort-first rendering).

- Error-based LOD selection and rendering quality.

- Single-pass GPU Raycasting.

@section Architecture Architecture

The architecture can be summarized with the picture below:

For each thread, the DASH library provides different views of data. And, because of its tree structure,
the volume octree can be represented using the DASH tree. The changes are then propagated between
threads.

@subsection Render_Thread Render thread

- Computing the LOD tree according to the viewpoint and sending the request to other threads for
the required nodes.
- Rendering the scene with the retrieved/available data.

@subsection GPU_Thread GPU upload thread

- Uploading the data to the GPU, and modifying the tree.
- Sending results to the rendering thread.
- Maintaining the GPU cache.

@subsection Data_Thread Data thread

- Uploading the data to CPU memory from disk/network etc and modifying the tree.
- Sending results to the GPU thread.
- Maintaining the main memory cache.

@subsection Livre_Library Livre library

Livre is composed of 3 main libraries:
- core: Collection of base classes for Cache, Dash based pipeline, Visitors and Rendering.
- Eq: Collection of implementations of classes for Equalizer classes.
- Lib: Collection of implementations of classes for Cache such as "Data Cache", "Texture Cache"
and Rendering.

Additionally, there are 3 different data sources that make use of the VolumeDataSourcePlugin
to support the following types of data sets:
- remote: Proxy for a remote ZeroEQ-based data source service.
- UVF: Supports pre-processed UVF volume data sets.
- memory (livre/Lib/Data/MemoryDataSource): Generates in-memory volume data.
